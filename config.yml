  # when retrieving word vectors, this will decide if the casing
  # of the word is relevant. E.g. `hello` and `Hello` will
  # retrieve the same vector, if set to `False`. For some
  # applications and models it makes sense to differentiate
  # between these two words, therefore setting this to `True`.
